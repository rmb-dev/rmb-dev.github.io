# Step-by-step guide to setting up homelab for media storage and streaming.

## Step 1: Choosing the Right Setup Approach

Option 1: Continue with Debian (Recommended for Simplicity)
Since you already have Debian installed with SSH, you can manually set up a file-sharing and media server using tools like:
Samba or NFS (for file sharing)
Plex or Jellyfin (for movie and music streaming)
Calibre Web (for book/magazine management)

Option 2: Use CasaOS (User-Friendly, NAS-Like)
CasaOS provides an easy-to-use web UI to manage your files and install apps like Plex, Jellyfin, and Nextcloud with Docker containers. It's simpler than Proxmox but still requires some Linux/Docker knowledge.

Option 3: Use Proxmox (For Virtualization & Expansion)
Proxmox is a hypervisor that lets you run multiple virtual machines (VMs) and containers. If you want separate environments (e.g., one VM for media, another for hacking labs), Proxmox is a great choice, but it has a learning curve.

## Step 2: Setting Up File Sharing
To access your files from different devices (Windows, Mac, Linux):

Option A: Use Samba (For Windows/macOS/Linux)
Install Samba:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba
```

Edit Samba config:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Add at the bottom:
```bash
[Media]
path = /home/yourusername/Media
read only = no
browsable = yes
guest ok = yes
```

Restart Samba:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart smbd
```

Access the share:
Windows: \\<server-ip>\Media
Linux: smb://<server-ip>/Media
macOS: smb://<server-ip>/Media
Option B: Use NFS (For Linux-based Devices)

Install NFS:
```bash
sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
```

Configure NFS:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/exports
```

Add:
```bash
/home/yourusername/Media *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
```

Restart NFS:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
```
## Step 3: Setting Up Media Streaming
Option A: Jellyfin (Free & Open-Source)
Install:
```bash
sudo apt install curl
curl -fsSL https://repo.jellyfin.org/debian/jellyfin_team.gpg.key | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/jellyfin.asc
echo "deb [arch=$( dpkg --print-architecture )] https://repo.jellyfin.org/debian bookworm main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jellyfin.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jellyfin
```

Start the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now jellyfin
```

Access it in a browser:
http://<server-ip>:8096

Option B: Plex (Easier but Requires Account)

Install:
```bash
sudo apt install apt-transport-https curl
curl https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/deb public main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plexmediaserver.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install plexmediaserver
```

Start Plex:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now plexmediaserver
```
Open http://<server-ip>:32400/web in a browser.

Step 4: Setting Up Book & Magazine Management
Option: Calibre-Web (For eBooks & PDFs)

Install dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Install Calibre-Web:
```bash
sudo pip3 install calibreweb
```

Run it:
calibre-web

Access in a browser:
http://<server-ip>:8083

Next Steps
Automate Downloads: Use Sonarr, Radarr, or Lidarr for automatic media downloads.
Secure Access: Set up a VPN (WireGuard) or use a reverse proxy (Nginx).
Consider Cloud Syncing: Nextcloud for cloud-style storage.
