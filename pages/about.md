# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
A self-taught front-end web developer with more than 3 years of experience, specializing in UX and UI design. My work is inspired by a minimalist approach to design with a focus on the most essential elements to match a sleek premium look. When I’m not working, I am fueled by my passion for road cycling, which helps me cultivate the discipline and endurance that are essential to my professional work.
