# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** üëãüèª,

I am an aspiring cybersecurity specialist with a strong focus on penetration testing. My expertise includes conducting security assessments on computer systems, networks, and web applications, identifying vulnerabilities, and analyzing security policies. I perform audits, evaluate risks, and provide actionable recommendations to strengthen defenses against cyber threats. My approach is methodical and detail-oriented, ensuring that security measures are both effective and adaptable to evolving attack vectors.

Before pivoting into cybersecurity, I spent over three years as a self-taught front-end web developer, specializing in UX and UI design. My design philosophy is rooted in minimalism, emphasizing essential elements to achieve a sleek, premium look.

Outside of work, I am passionate about road and gravel cycling, which helps me cultivate endurance and discipline.
